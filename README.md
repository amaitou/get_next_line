# Get Next Line

This is the `Third` project of `42Cursus`. <br />
`get next line` is a project that aims to read line by line from a given __File Descriptor__ .

**```Note: I haven't shared the PDF of this project, as well as, I haven't explained anything due to school privacy reasons!```**

This project consists of two parts:
- **Mandatory part** (Handle only one file descriptor)
- **Bonus Part** (Handle multiple file descriptors at the same time)

> Note: The **Bonus Part** is not that necessary to validate the project, but it gives some extra XPs and days for the **`The Blackhole`**.
